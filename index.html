        Hey there! My name is Gabriel and I'm an odd creature to say the least. I was born in Oakland, California but moved to San Jose, 
        Costa Rica when I was three. After attending kindergarten there, I moved to Tucson, Arizona when I was 5 and stayed there through college. 
        I studied sustainable architecture and city planning at the University of Arizona and graduated with a B.S. in 
        Sustainable Built Environments. 
      </p>

        After interning with Tucson's Office of Integrated Planning, I took a 180-degree turn and took a job as an automobile journalist in 
        San Francisco, where I currently reside. I test cars and write about them for a living, but I have an unquenchable thirst for learning
        and an outright obsession with technology and how it shapes the world. That thirst led me to attend this coding bootcamp
        where I aim to learn how to code and join the tech industry.
